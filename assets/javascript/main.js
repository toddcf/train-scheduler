// In this assignment, you'll create a train schedule application that
// incorporates Firebase to host arrival and departure data.
// Your app will retrieve and manipulate this information with Moment.js.
// This website will provide up-to-date information about various trains,
// namely their arrival times and how many minutes remain until they
// arrive at their station.



// Get current time (from Moment JS)

// Calculate next train's arrival time using current time.

// Users from many different machines must be able to view the same train times.
